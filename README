## About Me:
My first computer purchase wasn't a game but a programming language. I've been coding since the age of 15, and I'm now 52. I started on an Amiga 500 with 512 KB of RAM, which quickly got me hands-on with the code. Some might say it was the prehistory of computing, and they wouldn't be entirely wrong.

I began my journey working for the IT department of a public organization. Later, I delved into the realm of private companies. The 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s were like a world tour, working on projects for banks and telecoms in over 15 countries. This experience shaped me like a globetrotter, navigating through techniques and methodologies as diverse as the continents themselves.

On a personal note, I have a strong interest in robotics and develop small robots at home. The remarkable evolution of AI in recent years opens up numerous possibilities. I'm developing my AI to manage various aspects of my home, including security, energy, and reports.

## Proficient Technologies:
VMS, Unix, Linux, Windows
C, C++
PL/SQL, Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Apache Hive
PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Hadoop solution, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP, and machine learning, Koala AI

## Development Philosophy:
First and foremost, the key quality for anyone in the IT field is to never rest on their laurels; staying updated on technology is crucial. The emergence of AI in recent years is reshaping our profession, akin to the impact of Gutenberg's invention of the printing press on medieval scribes.

I believe a project should be meticulously designed, with analysis being the cornerstone of the work. Code is merely the translation into one language among many of the rules we wish to apply. Hence, the choice of programming language is of little importance, even though some may be more specialized.

When young programmers ask me which language to master, I tell them it matters little. While mastering a low-level language like C or C++ will teach them a lot, Python, currently booming, is a good language, especially with a large community for assistance.

I often conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) before the final version, allowing me to identify weaknesses in my approach and rectify them.
